Develop a browser userscript called "Later-List" using JavaScript. This script will function as a "read later" app with the following features:

### View page instructions

the app should be in dark mode.

The interface consists of multiple tabs, where each tab contains containers that store links.

There is a dedicated page that displays all saved links.

Users can drag and drop links between different containers and between different tabs.

there should be controls to create, delete and rename containers and tabs.

the view page/main interface should only be initialized and displayed when the current location.href is 'file:///D:/Mega/IDEs/JavaScript/[tm]%20laterList-view.html'

add example links, tabs and containers for the first use.

make sure the interface is pretty.

I need controls to add, delete and rename both tabs and containers. by dragging and dropping it should be possible to move the links among containers and tabs.

### Add links instructions

From any webpage, the user can save a link to a specific tab and container of their choice.

when the user is on a webpage, they can right-click on a link while holding the Ctrl key. this will display a small popup. In this popup, the user can select the destination tab and container for the link.

The script should work across all websites.
